Mobile Context Framework
========================

Short description
-----------------

The progressive spreading of wireless networks and increasingly powerful mobile computers creates a big potential for a wide spectrum of innovative applications. Context-aware applications adapt the circumstances of the user's current situation which enables new and intelligent user interfaces. Nevertheless, the sheer diversity of exploitable contexts and the plethora of sensing technologies are actually working against the deployment of context-aware systems. A framework for context retrieval should enable the development of context-aware applications without considering details of context acquisition and context management. Moreover, exchange and reusability of context information should be allowed between applications and users.

The *Mobile Context Framework* tries to solve the described issues. It consists of three components:

* The Mobile Context Server (this project)
* The [Mobile Context iPhone Library](http://github.com/flxmllr/mobile-context-iphone-lib/)
* The [Mobile Context iPhone Demo App](http://github.com/flxmllr/mobile-context-iphone-demo/)

The Mobile Context Server

### Installation notes ###

The Mobile Context Server consists of a [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/) Web application and a sample-ontology containing the context information. Here is how to set everything up:

1. Set up the triple store

test

2. Set up the Web application
